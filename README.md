# Covrage: The Open Source Policy Administration System
## Why
Insurance and Investment companies have a historical issue with managing policies, products, and the administration of them. There are many vended solutions for companies to use, but most of the time, they require large investments
and customizations within the system just to meet their needs.
All of the details around a vended policy admin system create a large bill for the companies that use them. 
I hope Covrage can become a **free** baseline policy admin system that allows companies to build their own Policy Admin system with customizations tailored *exactly* how they want it.
## Goal
Create a configurable and customizable policy admin system that encourages insurance and investment companies to create their own policy administration systems.
